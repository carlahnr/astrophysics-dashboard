# Astrophysics Dashboard

## About
 A dashboard style web application for visualizing astrophysics data, to aid in exoplanets discovery.
 Made in Python, it uses Plotly Dash for the data visualization elements and UI, Pandas for data manipulation, Flask as the web server. It uses Jinja, HTML, and is styled with Bootstrap 5's CSS.
 
 This application is similar to one I made for the Astrophysics Centre of the University of Porto. Comparing to the original one, this has some details modified to not use their intellectual property. The original one access their API for data, and this one uses a different data source.

## Screens
